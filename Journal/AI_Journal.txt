Week 1
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use AI for helping me explain some of the concepts more clearly and provide with some practice examples. For example, I asked ChatGPT with some concept on some basic data types, f-string, and type conversation.

Also, I tried to use ChatGPT to help me brainstorm with some of these concepts together for a program idea. This can help me better understand how to use Python to create a project. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68c78709-6968-800f-8459-97c1eac18d6e.html

Besides that, I learned a lot of new information with the assistance of ChatGPT because it can provide some new and clear explanation on the outputs and accuracy. So I think ChatGPT is a good AI tool for me to learn and practice the concept for Python. Although it may provide some information beyond my Python capabilities, as long as I make good use of it and modify some professional terms, it can still have a learning effect on me.

Week 2
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use ChatGPT to check the concepts and the explanation to the codes. Also, I used ChatGPT for helping me learning with the Python knowledge too. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68d087ff-07bc-800f-b7ca-999b5e30d7e5.html

Besides that, I used ChatGPT to help me learning with some common Python mistakes and how to fix them. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68d08b59-399c-800f-8088-18844238d730.html

Also, when I put some of my past codes in ChatGPT, it analysed and explained to me in a good and clear way. So it made me feel that ChatGPT can provide a lot of explanation on how and why the code works or made the mistakes, and how to fix the codes in the right way. Overall, I think the learning ad checking effect from ChatGPT works for me.

Week 3
In this week, I did not used AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use ChatGPT to help me debugging some of the codes and check some mistakes that I had made in the code. Also, I asked ChatGPT some ideas on how to use f-string in some real-world cases. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68d9facc-1f8c-800f-8210-188d9948874d.html

To explore more, I tried to use ChatGPT to comes up with some ways to do a Python project that can track the expenses and view the user's money. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68d9fd4e-807c-800f-bf8a-2c9e2f8f39e4.html

Additionally, I used ChatGPT to combine all the content and knowledge into some useful bullet points or cheatsheets, and that made me think that ChatGPT could be useful for analysis some specfic points into some good and clear ways. So I might try to figure out how it works with different AI models and test them out.
