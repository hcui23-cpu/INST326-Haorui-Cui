Week 1
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use AI for helping me explain some of the concepts more clearly and provide with some practice examples. For example, I asked ChatGPT with some concept on some basic data types, f-string, and type conversation.

Also, I tried to use ChatGPT to help me brainstorm with some of these concepts together for a program idea. This can help me better understand how to use Python to create a project. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68c78709-6968-800f-8459-97c1eac18d6e.html

Besides that, I learned a lot of new information with the assistance of ChatGPT because it can provide some new and clear explanation on the outputs and accuracy. So I think ChatGPT is a good AI tool for me to learn and practice the concept for Python. Although it may provide some information beyond my Python capabilities, as long as I make good use of it and modify some professional terms, it can still have a learning effect on me.

Week 2
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use ChatGPT to check the concepts and the explanation to the codes. Also, I used ChatGPT for helping me learning with the Python knowledge too. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68d087ff-07bc-800f-b7ca-999b5e30d7e5.html

Besides that, I used ChatGPT to help me learning with some common Python mistakes and how to fix them. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68d08b59-399c-800f-8088-18844238d730.html

Also, when I put some of my past codes in ChatGPT, it analysed and explained to me in a good and clear way. So it made me feel that ChatGPT can provide a lot of explanation on how and why the code works or made the mistakes, and how to fix the codes in the right way. Overall, I think the learning ad checking effect from ChatGPT works for me.

Week 3
In this week, I did not used AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use ChatGPT to help me debugging some of the codes and check some mistakes that I had made in the code. Also, I asked ChatGPT some ideas on how to use f-string in some real-world cases. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68d9facc-1f8c-800f-8210-188d9948874d.html

To explore more, I tried to use ChatGPT to comes up with some ways to do a Python project that can track the expenses and view the user's money. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68d9fd4e-807c-800f-bf8a-2c9e2f8f39e4.html

Additionally, I used ChatGPT to combine all the content and knowledge into some useful bullet points or cheatsheets, and that made me think that ChatGPT could be useful for analysis some specfic points into some good and clear ways. So I might try to figure out how it works with different AI models and test them out.

Week 4
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use ChatGPT to help me do some debugging with some exercises and learn some explanation to the code. Also, I asked ChatGPT some questions on the important keywords for Python. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68e2ca4c-f908-800f-9633-ba8712257380.html

In order to learn more, I used ChatGPT to make a Python code that can pull thr keywords so I can know some basics on how to work with the project. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68e2cba7-53e8-800f-b6a1-773b5091f8ae.html

Overall, I think that ChatGPT can able to put some useful knowledge of Python into lists or code examples. So I will continue to use ChatGPT as a useful tool with differet prompts and test them together as several questions. Even though it might shows different results, but as soon as I use some clear words and change with description, it will be a good way to learn Python together.

Week 5
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I dud use ChatGPT to help me check some explanation to the code and fix some of errors. Also, I asked ChatGPT some ways to better understand Python. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68ebe099-30a0-800f-8a21-f48ac1a85ae2.html

To learn more, I used ChatGPT to list some ways to better understand debugging so I can know hoe to do the code better. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68ebe41f-ccac-800f-b5d5-6f4ece941e0c.html

Besides that, ChatGPT can provide me a lot of useful way to behlp me better learning Python in a precise and easy way. Also, it can explain the structure of the code in a good way too. So I will use it to check and keep learning Python knowledge and debugging code together.

Week 6
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use ChatGPT to help me debugging some of the codes and learn some new Python knowledge about Object-Oriented-Programming. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68fe9178-6da8-800f-90af-69d83f954f07.html

Also, I used ChatGPT to teach me some ways to better know the types of errors in the code and how to fix them properly. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/68fe92f7-f590-800f-9d12-f7219d50cbc4.html

Besides that, ChatGPT is a good tool for me to debugging the codes and discover new Python analysis together. So I will continue to use it as a code fixer and learn through new content.

Week 7
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use ChatGPT to help me do the debugging and asked some questions on how to do better on understanding the error message. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/6907f590-651c-800f-aaff-aa9a7fe8f7ca.html

Also, I used ChatGPT to make some examples on Python code that can help me learn more knowledge on strings. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/6907fd48-4ef0-800f-9506-c9e94ad9bfa0.html

After learning with these contents together, I think I will continue to use ChatGPT to help me check and fix the errors with debugging to see if there can be more potential fix in Python codes.

Week 8
In this week, I did not use AI to help me with any of the exercises. But I did use ChatGPT to help me analysis and debugging on some codes. Also, I asked ChatGPT some questions about the meaning between classes and subclasses for the code. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/69113c8c-02e8-800f-b46f-5710ba945336.html

Besides that, I used ChatGPT to compare ad contrast the differences between different types of debugging, so I can able to know what is the best efficient way to debugging codes. The link of my AI chat is: file:///C:/Users/23cui/Downloads/69113e6a-7c74-800f-99fd-c17d83bbddad.html

Overall, by using ChatGPT as a tool, I can learn and practice more on Python code and improve my debugging skills. So I will use ChatGPT to help me learn and discover more for upcoming Python knowledge.
